# Close-source Projects

While I'm not at liberty to share the most of the projects I've done or work on in the scope of my previous jobs, I'm happy to describe some of them and describe them in more details privately via me via [hello@nicolasbrugneaux.me](mailto:hello@nicolasbrugneaux.me).

<ul class="list">

  <p class="list__primary-content">
    <a href="https://github.com/celo-org/" target="_blank">Clabs developer tooling</a>
  </p>
  <span class="list__secondary-content">
    From typescript SDKs, web UIs, CLIs, ledger integration, to backend and devops. You could call me a jack of all trades. At Clabs I got the opportunity to work on many different tech stacks and projects. Hit me up to know more.

    One example publicly available is Datawallet's chrome extension has been a work of labour at Datawallet. Despite being abandonned, it is still a cool piece of technology. It's built with wasm, js, and Cosmos Blockchain.

# Open-source Projects

Early in my carreer I used to invest a lot more time in open-source projects. Here are a few of them I initiated myself or contributed to.

{% assign groups = site.data.projects|group_by:"category" %}
{% assign groups = groups|sort:"name" %}
{% for category in groups %}

  <h2>{{ category.name }}</h2>
  <ul class="list">
  {% assign projects = category.items|sort:"name" %}
  {% for project in projects %}
    <li class="list__item">
      <p class="list__primary-content">
        <a href="{{ project.link }}" target="_blank">{{ project.name }}</a>
      </p>
      <span class="list__secondary-content">{{ project.description }}</span>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
